# RoboticsLectures

My newest take on lectures on basic robotics. Hopefully I will continue this one for longer than the previous one.

So far:

s001 - kinematics for rotating a point, SO(3) group and exponential map
s002 - kinematics for rotating a point, but using SE(3)
s003 - kinematics for a double pendulum, SE(3)

s004 - differential inverse kinematics, make a line/circle with a double pendulum

s005 - Lagrange dynamics for a single pendulum
s006 - Lagrange dynamics for a double pendulum, with file outputs for D ddq + C = 0
